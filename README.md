### Important!

The database that the server connects ot is /backend/database/Chat.db.
This database is git ignored to avoid having to commit all changes to the db
If you have made a fresh clone of the repo you MUST:

- Copy the file /backend/database/Chat-template.db and rename the copy /backend/database/Chat.db
